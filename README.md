# boiler-theme
This is Yosuke's Wordpress boiler template. Its got some handy functions that I use often and a scss/coffeescript hierarchy that links well with a gulpfile that I've generated in one of my gists https://gist.github.com/yosukehasumi/d21f3ed89171ea5fc234

Also if you are on Mac I've got a handy bash script that can create a new WP site for you from scratch, see my gist here: https://gist.github.com/yosukehasumi/d0c905da78229122e7c1bb34a0fc92a7
